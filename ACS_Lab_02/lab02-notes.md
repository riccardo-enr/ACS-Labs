# Lab02.2 - Notes

## Thresholds

- $a_4 = 200 \; rad/s^2$
- $a_3$ not used
- $a_2 = -400 \; rad/s^2$
- $a_1 = -420 \; rad/s^2$

# Lab02.3 - Notes

$a_3$ threshold in not considered.
Pressure slopes are already defined as a start.

Acceleration thresholds are in $rad/s^2$ and pressure slopes are in $MPa/s$.

### Additional constraint
Add it later if all works correctly by just tuning the thresholds.
